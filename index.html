       The role of HTML is to provide the base structure for the web page. Web browswers are able to intrepret HTML to show the content to the user. Websites use HTML to create the structure for the website but rely upon CSS and Javascript in order to make the website look good.  Using HTML the developer can include text, images, links, and more to a website.

      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, provides a website with colors, layout, and design. Without CSS a webpage will look very basic with only the built-in styling of HTML to provide design. This is done through changing the attributes of different HTML tags which changes how the element appears on the web page.

    Javascript's role in web development is to provide functionality to a website. Javascript allows a web developer to change the static HTML and CSS elements into a dynamic experience for the user. With Javascript a developer increases the usability of the website to include navigation and reactive elements.
